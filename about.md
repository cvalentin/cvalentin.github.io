My name is Carlo Valentin and I'm enjoying life in Seattle. I'm an information security consultant currently working for NCC Group. I enjoy programming, video games, and most things infosec.

This website exists as a collection of things I've worked on and opinions I elaborate over. From game critiques to my personal musings, I hope this site becomes a project I can regularly update and share my discoveries.
